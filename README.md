# neural-networks-practice

This was my first time training a neual network with pytorch.

I studied deep learning and started experimenting with them in this repo.

I studied dropout technique, early stopping method, batch normalization, and different regularization metrics.

The dataset I worked with was Fashion MNIST dataset.
